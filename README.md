# Advanced Users ONLY

**These are provided AS-IS with no support or guarantee from TH3D Studio LLC.**

[Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) is an advanced, tweaking firmware that is complex to setup and use. You are welcome to use whatever firmware you wish on our boards but we only support our Unified 2 Firmware on them when it comes to what our included Technical Support covers at no cost due to the complexity of Klipper and the stack of software required to use it.

**Paid Klipper Support**

If you wish to get help setting up Klipper on your control board and/or SBC we do have paid remote support services available.

**Setting up your SBC**

For setting up your SBC we recommend [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh) to set it up on a standard Linux installation.

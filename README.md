[Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) is an advanced, tweaking firmware that is complex to setup and use. You are welcome to use whatever firmware you wish on our boards but we only support our Unified 2 Firmware on them when it comes to what our included Technical Support covers at no cost.

Make sure you read the official Klipper [Installation information](https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html) and follow their [directions](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html).

# Advanced Users ONLY

**These are provided AS-IS with no support or guarantee from TH3D Studio LLC.**

[Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) is an advanced, tweaking firmware that is complex to setup and use. You are welcome to use whatever firmware you wish on our boards but we only support our Unified 2 Firmware on them when it comes to what our included Technical Support covers at no cost due to the complexity of Klipper and the stack of software required to use it.

**Pre-Compiled BIN Files**

We've also provided pre-compiled BIN files to flash your boards so you don't have to use SSH + WinSCP to get the firmware.bin files. These files will be kept up to date on a best effort basis. You will still need to connect in via SSH to get your board ID and we recommend [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh) to get that with the Advanced Menu (option 4) and then Get MCU ID (option 5) over USB (option 1).

Klipper doesn't change the core board firmware much so this shouldn't be a big issue. If you find that our pre-compiled BIN files are out of date please [Contact Us](https://contactus.th3dstudio.com) to have them updated.

**Paid Klipper Support**

If you wish to get help setting up Klipper on your control board and/or SBC we do have paid remote support services available.

**Setting up your SBC**

For setting up your SBC we recommend [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh) to set it up on a standard Linux installation.
